4. **Free Energy of Binding:** A critical parameter in drug design and enzyme kinetics, indicating the strength and specificity of the interaction between two molecules. Molecular simulations can calculate this through techniques like free energy perturbation (FEP) and thermodynamic integration.

5. **Radius of Gyration:** Reflects the compactness of a molecule, which is particularly relevant in polymer science and protein folding studies. It can be measured experimentally through techniques such as small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS).

6. **Diffusion Coefficients:** Indicate how fast molecules or ions diffuse through a medium. Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations can predict these values, which can then be compared with experimental data obtained from methods like nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) or dynamic light scattering (DLS).

7. **Solvation Free Energy:** Essential for understanding solute-solvent interactions, crucial in fields ranging from pharmaceuticals to energy storage. This can be experimentally determined through various calorimetric techniques or inferred from solubility measurements.

8. **Melting Points and Phase Transitions:** The temperature at which a solid becomes a liquid, or other phase transitions, can be predicted by simulations that explore the stability of different phases at varying temperatures. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) provides experimental validation.

9. **Vibrational Spectra:** Including IR (Infrared) and Raman spectra, can be predicted using molecular simulations that calculate the vibrational modes of molecules. These predictions can be directly compared with spectra obtained from IR or Raman spectroscopy.

10. **Mechanical Properties:** Such as Young's modulus, tensile strength, and glass transition temperature for polymers and materials, can be estimated from simulations and compared with experimental values obtained from mechanical testing.

11. **Permeability:** Particularly in drug design, where the ability of a compound to permeate cell membranes is crucial. Experimental validation can come from various biological assays and permeability studies.

12. **Electrochemical Properties:** Such as redox potentials, which are vital in the design of batteries and electrochemical sensors. These properties can be predicted through simulations and validated using electrochemical methods like cyclic voltammetry.

13. **Thermodynamic Stability:** Of various polymorphs or molecular conformations, which is essential in materials science and pharmaceuticals. X-ray crystallography or differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) can provide experimental confirmation.

14. **Hydration Shells and Water Structure:** Around biomolecules or ions, critical for understanding biological interactions and solvation dynamics. Neutron scattering and X-ray absorption spectroscopy are among the techniques that can experimentally probe water structure.

15. **Enzyme Kinetics:** Simulations can predict the rate of enzymatic reactions and the effect of mutations on enzyme activity, which can be validated using various biochemical assays.
