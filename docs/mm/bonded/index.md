# Bonded interactions

Bonded interactions are the chemical bonds formed by the sharing of electrons between atoms.
These strong interactions play a crucial role in determining the structure, stability, and reactivity of molecules.
In the context of drug design, bonded interactions are essential for understanding the binding of drugs to their targets.
Bonded drugs, which form irreversible bonds with their targets, have unique advantages and disadvantages compared to non-covalent drugs.
