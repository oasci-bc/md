# Electrostatic

Interactions resulting from non-uniform distribution of electron densities between molecules are considered electrostatic.
We primarily hear about this as an "unequal sharing of electrons" in chemistry.
In general, there are two broad categories of molecular mechanics representation of electrostatic interactions:

-   [Pairwise additive](./pairwise/), and
-   [Polarizable](./polarizable/).
